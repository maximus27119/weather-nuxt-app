				<p>Hey there! 👋</p>
				<p>I built this weather forecast website to make checking the weather simple, accurate, and useful for your daily plans. With a clean and intuitive interface, you can get real-time weather updates, a 5-day forecast, and even personalized clothing recommendations based on the conditions in your city. 🧥🌡️</p>
				<p>The site is powered by Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, and external APIs to ensure a smooth experience on any device. It uses OpenWeather for weather data and Mapbox for location services, so you always get the most precise and up-to-date forecasts. 🗺️☀️ To keep things secure and efficient, I’ve also implemented a proxy server that adds an extra layer of protection for user requests. 🔒</p>
				<p>From designing the UI to deploying the site on Vercel, I’ve focused on speed, usability, and reliability. Whether you're planning your day or packing for a trip, I’ve got you covered with the right info at the right time. ✅</p>
				<p>I also use images & icons from <u><a href="https://www.freepik.com/">Freepik</a></u> to enhance the visual experience, making the site both functional and aesthetically pleasing. 🎨✨</p>
				<p>Thanks for stopping by—stay weather-ready! 🌦️🚀</p>
